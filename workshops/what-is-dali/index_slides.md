* Appetite is a mobile application to help conduct studies as part of on-going research for a team in the Psychology and Brain Sciences Department at Dartmouth.Â  The app helps users build willpower through games that utilize a classic inhibition task process (stop-signal task). We found that participants decreased their desires to eat and ate less after the training.

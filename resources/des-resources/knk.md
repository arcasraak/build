## How to use the mat cutter tool

Go to: [knk.dali.dartmouth.edu](http://knk.dali.dartmouth.edu)

This is where you will print from. 

## Prep your SVG file

The printer takes SVG files that are composed of only outlines that are 1pix wide.  More [here](https://cutterpunk.com/svg-files-for-cutting-machines/).

## Prep for cutting/drawing

Full manual can be found [here](http://www.iloveknk.com/0um/Force-with-C3/KNKForce-with-C3-UM.pdf). 

Overview: 

1. Place material onto mat
1. Make sure rollers are aligned
1. Choose which (left/right) tool you want.

1. Upload your SVG
1. "Prepare this cutting job"
1. Place the cutting tool to the bottom right hand corner where you want to start cutting from.
1. and you are done!

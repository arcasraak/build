Push the design further with the feedback captured from last week. Complete the Hi-Fi designs for any additional states or pages that werenâ€™t completed in the previous week. Prepare for science fair style share outs by updating the prototype and clearing out any stale or completed comments.

If you have an interaction-heavy project, start to develop the Interaction Design (IxD). Take care to select the [appropriate prototyping tool](http://www.prototypr.io/prototyping-tools/) for this. For detailed interactions recommended tools are Proto.io, Principle, or Framer. Look ahead to next week where you'll be adding delight, and pace yourself accordingly (i.e. there's time for an animated loading page next week!).

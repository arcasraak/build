This is the document that determines the **look and feel** of the project.
  * It outlines the color, fonts, spacing, and some UI elements.
  * The earlier you settle on a style guide, the better, since it's a great **resource** for you to reference while working on the bulk of your High Fidelity Mockups.
  * Continue to update as you make final decisions in context.
  * Create Symbols or Components in your design file of these elements so you can easily apply changes to your entire entire design.
    * Some tips on [setting up this system.](https://medium.com/ux-power-tools/5-things-to-do-before-you-start-your-next-design-file-in-sketch-or-preparing-your-design-mise-en-ff7ea9fe3722)

Once the designs are finalized, you’re ready to package it up. All designs and mockups are stored in the Drive, so make sure your project’s Google Drive has all relevant design materials.
* **final full page mockups** (exported from your design tool as jpeg or png, do NOT take screenshots)
* final design file(s)
* final packaged assets (fonts, logos, images, icons)
* style archive (the polished, edited, final version of the style guide)

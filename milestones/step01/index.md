## Research and Code Experiment

Take time in Step 2 to research products and users, and create personas. Conduct code experiment 1.

### PM:
* [ ] Scheduling (team check-ins, partner meetings, mentor meetings)
* [ ] Follow up with partner on any pending questions and needs

### Dev:
* [ ] [Code Experiment 0](code-experiment-0.md)

### Des:
* [ ] [User Research](user-research.md)
* [ ] [Current-State User Journey](current-state-user-journey.md)

### Everyone:
* [ ] [Personas](#personas)


## Personas
Personas are hypotheses informed by our research. They capture basic demographics, motivations, and frustrations. The purpose of Personas is to inspire empathy which is the key to understanding irrational responses.

Aim for 2-4 personas that accurately describe the variety of users that will use your product.

Consult this template to fill in details about your users. Feel free to include any additional dimensions that help you think about and understand your user in relation to your project (e.g., knowledge, skills, interest, technique, languages, platform, etc.)

* Goals: what the users want to achieve in life â€“ what motivates them
* Tech-savviness: the lower the number, the more critical it is to make the design intuitive
* Age: hints at a mindset based on current life phase, generation, and their cultural and economic experiences.
* Frustrations: what must be fixed to improve the user experience
* Quotes: pick a key moment to describe their character, their emotions, or their experiences
* Keywords: a quick summary of standout personality traits, especially tags that might heavily affect design decisions

Once you have feedback from your partner on your sketches, start to define a direction and add details. Now is a good time to transition into a design tool like Sketch or Figma.

Prepare to iterate as you determine the best way to display information, work through a flow, or integrate content. Refer back to your Competitive/Comparative for inspiration and interface examples.

## Guidelines:  
* Mid-fidelity grayscales™ should include real-ish content wherever possible (don’t let a content problem hold you back from more designing, but the more realistic the content, the more intelligent you can be with design decisions)
* Do NOT worry yet about fonts, colors, grid systems, or design elements (i.e. use a basic font, shades of gray, and boxes for images or video placeholders)
* Design for each unique page. Alternate states of those pages can come later in visual design

## Prioritize. Sketch Main Features. Code scaffolding.

Define the core features and sketch those features as a team. Present sketched options to your partner for feedback and a design direction. Setup initial code scaffolding with tools and frameworks chosen.

### Everyone:
* 1: Write [Project Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eUOWSDpmRE9037nOym1h5oGvgmbrT-mZnaj9arZcxyQ/edit)
  * Must be approved by DALI staff before sending to partner
* 2: [Feature Spec](feature-specification.md)


### PM:
* Set up a time for Team dinner/meal/activity
* Evaluate progress and milestones to-date
  * Is your team on track? Are they facing any blockers? What needs to happen to get/stay on track? Are you working towards team and individual goals?
* Define milestones for next three weeks
  * After evaluating your progress to-date, does anything need to be adjusted?
* Gather all content/data from the partner
  * The partner is 100% responsible for the content. Work with them to get all of it and help them refine it if need be. This includes any wording (paragraphs, buttons, etc.), data, photos, videos, etc.
* Set up Rapid User Testing for next week
  * As before, reach out to new users and schedule times to conduct Rapid User Testing during week 3.


### Des:
* [Connecting Features](connecting-features.md) - consolidate features and sketch out possible connections + solutions
* [Paper Sketches](paper-sketches.md) - give these features a shape and form to get everyone on the same page


### Dev:
* [Code scaffolding](code-scaffolding.md)



### Wednesday Deliverables:
  * Feature Spec
  * 2-3 clean hand sketches of each main feature on device paper, scanned and uploaded to your InVision Board
  * Completed Code Scaffolding


### Wednesday Activity:
  * Share out paper sketches <!-- science fair style -->
  * Share out dev experiments

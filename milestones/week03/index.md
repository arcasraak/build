## Define and Code Experiment

Define the core features and sketch those features as a team. Present sketched options to your partner for feedback and a design direction. Conduct code experiment 1.

### PM:
* [ ] Set up a time for Team dinner/meal/activity
* [ ] Evaluate progress and milestones to-date
  * Is your team on track? Are they facing any blockers? What needs to happen to get/stay on track? Are you working towards team and individual goals?
* [ ] Define milestones for next three weeks
  * After evaluating your progress to-date, does anything need to be adjusted?
* [ ] Gather all content/data from the partner
  * The partner is 100% responsible for the content. Work with them to get all of it and help them refine it if need be. This includes any wording (paragraphs, buttons, etc.), data, photos, videos, etc.
* [ ] Set up Rapid User Testing for next week
  * As before, reach out to new users and schedule times to conduct Rapid User Testing during week 3.
  * Now that you have a good understanding of the project, the [Feature Spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWNzAXyMH1gEyB6JDcAEkzpnNypdZPcqe3v6B2Uov7w/edit#heading=h.b1z22ibegd3m) is where devs and designers will put their heads together to hammer out the details.

### Dev:
* [ ] [Code Experiment 1](code-experiment-1.md)
*OR*
* [ ] [start on Code Scaffolding](../week04/code-scaffolding.md)


### Des:
* [ ] Categorize the problems you uncovered
* [ ] [Connecting Features](connecting-features.md) - sketch out possible connections + solutions for the problems you identified
* [ ] [Paper Sketches](paper-sketches.md) - start associating these features with the device in mind

### Wednesday Deliverables:
  * Paper sketches
  * Code experiment 1

### Wednesday Activity:
  * Share out paper sketches <!-- science fair style -->
  * Share out dev experiments

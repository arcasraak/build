## Define and Code Experiment

Define the core components of your project and develop lightweight sketches of critical features. Complete code experiment 1.

### PM:
* [ ] Set up a time for Team dinner/meal/activity
* [ ] Evaluate progress and milestones to-date
  * Is your team on track? Are they facing any blockers? What needs to happen to get/stay on track? Are you working towards team and individual goals?
* [ ] Define milestones for next three weeks
  * After evaluating your progress to-date, does anything need to be adjusted?
* [ ] Gather all content/data from the partner
  * The partner is 100% responsible for the content. Work with them to get all of it and help them refine it if need be. This includes any wording (paragraphs, buttons, etc.), data, photos, videos, etc.

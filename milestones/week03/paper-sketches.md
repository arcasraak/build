What do these features look like? How do they actually work?
Paper sketches are done by hand, to keep the fidelity low.

Benefits:
  * take the abstract to concrete to get everyone on the same page
  * rule out ideas or features that aren't feasible
  * build and iterate on the features that are feasible


Rules:
  * Use device paper - print out some [pre-made templates](https://marvelapp.com/sketchpad/)
  * Fidelity is at its lowest
    * Use the “thick marker trick” - the thicker the marker, the more you force yourself to keep the designs at a conceptual level, since it’s difficult to add in details when the marker tip is so large. Whiteboard markers are great here too, just take photos.
  * Include no specific content
  * Drop any worries about scale, straight lines, or "prettiness"
  * Think in flows whenever possible (what pages come after?)
  * Never settle for your first idea!


## Tasks:
  * Sketch dozens of options for your main features
  * Scan and upload cleaned up sketches on device paper to Figma
    * Keep 2-3 distinct versions for testing and feedback
    * Get feedback from your partner and mentors and iterate


#### Technique: Rapid Group Sketching
  * Determine which **(3-6) essential features** you will sketch together
  * Get thick markers, device paper, and designate a timekeeper
  * Sketch individually for **3 minutes per feature**, creating as many unfiltered iterations as possible in that time limit
  * Share sketches with each other
  * Create a few group versions that incorporates the best of all the ideas

Time to take the abstract to concrete. Sketch rough layouts of screens focused on **features**.
 - give these features a shape and form to get everyone on the same page

**Step 1:** Generate options as a group
* Review your design artifacts created thus far (personas, user journeys, flows)
* Answer any pressing questions, voice any concerns or challenges to keep in mind
* Determine which **(3-6) main features** you will sketch that are essential to your product (e.g. the feed, leaderboard, comments, etc)
* Get thick markers, printer paper, and designate a timekeeper
* Allow for **5 minutes of individual sketching per feature**, working on as many unfiltered iterations as possible in that time limit. Treat this much like improv - try not to self-edit or rule out anything just yet.
* After each round, compare sketches and create a few group versions that incorporates the best of all the ideas. Actively agree/disagree with specific elements. Aim for **2-3 versions per feature**. Save these for Step 2.

Rules:
* Fidelity is at its lowest. Use the “thick marker trick” - the thicker the marker, the more you force yourself to keep the designs at a conceptual level (it’s difficult to add in details when the marker tip is so large!). Whiteboard markers are great here too, just take photos!
* Include little or no specific content
* Drop any worries about scale, straight lines, grids, etc.
* Think in flows whenever possible (what pages come after?)
* Match your sketches with your flow diagram - what part of the flow is not yet in the sketch?
* Never settle for your first idea!

**Step 2:** Clean up sketches for feedback

Using the group sketches as fuel, transfer and clean up all your sketches onto device paper. Note: sketching by hand at this stage (in lieu of a digital program) saves time, and also helps the partner feel more invited to provide feedback.

**Present 2-3 clean versions of each feature on device paper to the partner for feedback. Each version should be different enough discuss direction and determine a plan to move forward as a team.**

Example Device Paper:

Feel free to use this or make your own, appropriate for the device you are developing for.

#Tasks:
2-3 sketches of each main feature on device paper, scanned and uploaded to your Figma Project "Week 3"

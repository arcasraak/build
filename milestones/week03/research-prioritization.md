Now that you have listened to the user, you have quite a challenge: what insights to act on, which ones to prioritize, and how?


## 1. Managing differing opinions.
* User A says they love hitting the snooze button, but User B says they prefer to just jump out of bed and get going. If you were trying to design a better wake up experience, what would you do?
The key is realizing that one size (or app) doesn't fit all. Users A and B both offer super valuable insights, which will allow you to design states for both Persona types (users who use snooze, and users who do not - for example).


## 2. Specifying your users.
You may determine with your partner that the product you are designing is specifically for those who have *difficulty* waking up. In which case, you operate on the basis that you are designing for User A, not as much for User B. If User B was it's own Persona that doesn't have difficulty waking up, you can set it aside.


## 3. Awesome but out of scope / off topic features.
Narrowing scope is always a difficult process. Oftentimes user research unearths so many exciting and tangential (or entirely unrelated but cool) ideas. For the success of the project, and the team, you must methodically sort through all the insights you received and prioritize. One way to do this is by typing up each feature request in a spreadsheet. Each column is a category or theme, and each row is a priority level. Each individual cell is a specific feature that came up in the user research. The insight that pertain to a person's breakfast routine might not be directly relevant to the "wake up experience" product, so it can stay off the chart or settle in the lowest priority row for later.


## 4. Determining a direction.
With a spreadsheet like the one you made above, you can now easily choose and select which features to focus on in the first design sprint. Aim for anywhere between 5 and 10 features.

Feature examples:
* Alarm options (sounds, wakeup timeframe)
* Snooze options (sounds, time, interactions to snooze again)
* Community space - for posting/answering/upvoting better wake up experiences
* Sleep Pattern Analysis
* How it works breakdown
* Contact customer service


## 5. Creating the story.
This is the master story for your prototype. The idea is to lace together all the features from your feature list into a cohesive journey, helping you add in extra color and/or solidify the concept for the team. The more detailed this is, the more you can rely on it later in the design phase (i.e. user testing, prototype creation, demo video).

Use the list of features as a type of reverse Mad Lib exercise. The features are the parts you know, and the outline of the story is what you need to complete. Write in the third person, and start to define what happens on which pages.

"Just before shutting off the light to go to sleep, Susan opens her Wake Up app.

[home page]
She sets her *alarm time* for 7:00 and sees that she'll be getting 8 hours of sleep, a bit more than average.
[analysis page]
She briefly checks how much she slept the night before, and how well, before activating the monitor sleep mode and putting her phone to charge by her bed.

## Term 2 Additions:

* Determine which features should be added to stick to the goals set in week 1.
* Build instead of rebuild, and be careful not to scrap other work just because it's easier.

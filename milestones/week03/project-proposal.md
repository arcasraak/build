How has your research changed the scope, scale, or implementation of the proposed solution?

This is a document outlining statement of purpose, stakeholders, proposed solution, & timeline.

Project Proposals must be pitched by your group to the DALI Staff before submission to the partner. Proposals are iterative (in response to staff & partner feedback) & required before moving to the next step.  


## Project Proposal

This will be a short document outlining your plans for the project.

Here is a template for a project proposal that you should create using the github wiki functionality.

```
# Project Name Proposal
### Team Members

(Insert a Team Photo URL here)

## Problem Statement

What is the problem you are aiming to solve? Who are your target users?

## Impact

Briefly explain how the project meets a real-world need.

## Prior Work

Include any existing solutions and explain how you plan on differentiating your product. You should have ~10 different sources. These can range from commercial/competitive solutions to research papers that inform some part of your product.

## Proposed Solution

Briefly describe your proposed solution.  How does it work and what does it do?

## Team

Who are your team members? Identify what skills each team member brings to the table as well as preferred work style (take charge, work alone, pair programming, etc).

## Strategy

Outline your development strategy with general feature milestones - identify minimum viable product features and optional stretch goals. Explain how you plan to test your product.

## Implementation Challenges

What development challenges have you thought about so far?  Identify any risks and briefly discuss possible workarounds / alternatives.

## Meeting Schedule

You are required to spend at least 10 hours/week. Outline a general weekly meeting schedule with at least 1 time that everybody can make. At least that one meeting must include the entire team in the same room, in person. The rest of the 10 hours may be split into several sessions throughout the week. A nice tool for this is [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/).

```

Your project proposal describes the concept and core components of your project.  It includes things to think about as you are refining the project scope so take a look at this early!


## Github Markdown Files and Repo

We'll use this opportunity to get your first project repo started! You should have had a GitHub repo created for you, if not contact your core mentor and they can set you up.

## GitHub wiki

We'll be using github wikis to keep track of some project documentation. If you haven't used it before [here's how](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/). And some tips on using [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

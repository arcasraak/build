Create a document outlining the list of features and functionality of the proposed solution. This is an iterative document that may change over time, and is required before moving to the next step.

The Feature Spec must be submitted to and approved by the DALI Staff.

The feature spec is a document that is a walk-though of your project from the users perspective. It provides a listing of all the features you are envisioning for the product. The feature spec functions as your overall plan for the project. Rather than thinking about it as locking you in, use this as an opportunity to think through your product in detail. Think of it as a living document, donâ€™t be afraid to change it later as your ideas about the project mature. It does not need to be an overly extensive document. Joel Spolsky (of Stackoverflow and more recently Trello) has a nice writeup of the why and how of specs here: [joelonsoftware](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000035.html). He references an [overly long example](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/WhatTimeIsIt.html). Weâ€™ll simplify things a little bit and keep our document shorter and although he says only one person should write the spec, you should definitely do this as your whole team!


## Github Markdown Files and Repo

We'll use this opportunity to get your first project repo started! You should have had a GitHub repo created for you, if not contact your core mentor and they can set you up.

## GitHub wiki

We'll be using github wikis to keep track of some project documentation. If you haven't used it before [here's how](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/). And some tips on using [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

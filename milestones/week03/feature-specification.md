Your Feature Spec is a listing of all the features you are envisioning for the product. It may change later as your ideas about the project mature.

Benefits:
  * It functions as your overall plan for the project.
  * It helps you determine which features to start on, and estimate level of effort.
  * It is as an opportunity to think through your product in detail.


## Tasks:
  * List out all features (from your partner, from user research, and from your own team brainstorming)
  * Go through those features and rate the **priority for completion** *1, 2, or 3*
    * 1 - what you start with - necessary for handoff
    * 2 - you might/might not get to, depending on complexity
    * 3 - your icebox and likely not tackled this term
  * Rank those features for **estimate (of effort)** with *1-10* (10 being most difficult)
  * Create Github/Zenhub issues for each feature (include the "estimate" number)
  * Submit your Feature Spec for **approval** by the DALI Staff.



### Github Markdown Files and Repo
We'll use this opportunity to get your first project repo started! You should have had a GitHub repo created for you, if not contact your mentor.

### GitHub wiki
We'll be using github wikis to keep track of some project documentation. If you haven't used it before [here's how](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/). And some tips on using [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

##Feature Spec
Your Feature Spec provides a listing of all the features you are envisioning for the product. It may change later as your ideas about the project mature.

Benefits:
  * It functions as your overall plan for the project.
  * It helps you determine which features to start on, and estimate level of effort.
  * It is as an opportunity to think through your product in detail.


##Tasks:
  *   List out all features (from your partner, from user research, and from your own team's brainstorming sessions)
  *   Go through that list and rate the **priority** *1, 2, or 3*
    * Bonus if you also rank those features for **effort**
    * Mark a *High, Medium, Low* for LOE (level of effort)
    * Focus on 5-10 "core features" that are 1 or 2 in priority
      * Aim for a balance of LOE (e.g. Low effort but high priority = "quick wins")
  * These should all be expressed as Github/Zenhub issues
  * Submit your Feature Spec for **approval** by the DALI Staff.


### Github Markdown Files and Repo
We'll use this opportunity to get your first project repo started! You should have had a GitHub repo created for you, if not contact your mentor.

### GitHub wiki
We'll be using github wikis to keep track of some project documentation. If you haven't used it before [here's how](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/). And some tips on using [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

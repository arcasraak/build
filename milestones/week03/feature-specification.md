### What is a Feature Spec?
The feature spec is the **master document for your prototype and is a living breathing document**.
  * It is a walk-though story of your project from the users perspective.
  * It provides a listing of all the features you are envisioning for the product.
  * It functions as your overall plan for the project.
  * It is as an opportunity to think through your product in detail.
  * It may change later as your ideas about the project mature.
  * It involves your entire team.

#### Use the Connecting Features task to help select which features and pages you identify in your Feature Spec.

## Requirements:

1: Identify the **5 to 10 core features** to focus on in the first design sprint.

> Example:
- Alarm options (sounds, wakeup timeframe)
- Snooze options (sounds, time, interactions to snooze again)
- Community space - for posting/answering/upvoting
- Sleep Pattern Analysis
- How it works
- Contact customer service

<br/>

2: Associate these features with specific pages

> Example:
- Analysis Page
- Profile Page
- Home Page
- Community Page

<br/>

3: Lace together all the features from your feature list into a cohesive script.
  * Solidify the concept, the user, and the setting.
  * Add detail to rely on later in the design phase (i.e. user testing, prototype creation, narration for the demo video).
  * Define what happens on which pages.

> Example:
- Just before shutting off the light to go to sleep, Susan opens her Wake Up app.
- [loading page]
- [home page]
- She sets her *alarm time* for 7:00 and sees that she'll be getting 8 hours of sleep, a bit more than average.
- [analysis page]
- She briefly checks how much she slept the night before, and how well, before activating the monitor sleep mode and putting her phone to charge by her bed.
- [sleeping mode]


<br/>

* These should all be expressed as Github/Zenhub issues
* Submit your Feature Spec for **approval** by the DALI Staff.



### Github Markdown Files and Repo

We'll use this opportunity to get your first project repo started! You should have had a GitHub repo created for you, if not contact your core mentor and they can set you up.

### GitHub wiki

We'll be using github wikis to keep track of some project documentation. If you haven't used it before [here's how](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/). And some tips on using [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Create a document outlining the list of features and functionality of the proposed solution. This is an iterative document that will change over time, and is required before moving to the next step.
Your entire group should be involved in creating this, not just your PM or design team.

The Feature Spec must be **submitted** to and **approved** by the DALI Staff.

The feature spec is a document that is a walk-though of your project from the users perspective. It provides a listing of all the features you are envisioning for the product. The feature spec functions as your overall plan for the project. Rather than thinking about it as locking you in, use this as an opportunity to think through your product in detail.

Think of it as a living document, donâ€™t be afraid to change it later as your ideas about the project mature. This should not be longer than a page for most projects.  Itâ€™s really the story of what using the app is like from the end user perspective.


[EXAMPLE Feature Spec ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pWNzAXyMH1gEyB6JDcAEkzpnNypdZPcqe3v6B2Uov7w)


Break down the functionality by view for example:
* login page
* profile with name, birthday, photo


These should all be expressed as Github/Zenhub issues:

## Github Markdown Files and Repo

We'll use this opportunity to get your first project repo started! You should have had a GitHub repo created for you, if not contact your core mentor and they can set you up.

## GitHub wiki

We'll be using github wikis to keep track of some project documentation. If you haven't used it before [here's how](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/). And some tips on using [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

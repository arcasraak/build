It's time to maximize our usage of github by using some project management features in addition to your current git flow of feature branches and pull requests.

❓ When should you use GitHub issues?<br>
✅ ALWAYS!

❓ What is the right scope for an issue?<br>
✅ You can think of issues as individual tasks: "create login button",  "api endpoint for user profile", etc.  Issues can also be bugs that you find along the way.  Break up large tasks into individual smaller ones, each one should be under a few hours of work.  The smaller the tasks the actually faster you will work (not just the appearance of speed). It is easier to take on a manageable scope issue and work through it than if the issue has multiple steps that quickly become overwhelming to think through.

❓ Should I assign my teammates to issues?<br>
✅ Yes! You should assign people to each issue as you work on them so your team knows who is doing what. Feel free to assign each other tasks, a little aggressiveness is ok!

## Grayscales™, Code Scaffolding

Create Grayscales™ for each main interaction and screen. Conduct rapid user testing to validate design solutions. Setup initial code scaffolding with tools and frameworks chosen.

### PM:
* [ ] Evaluate team velocity
  * Use Zenhub’s velocity measurements to evaluate your team’s working speed. By now you should have a good idea of what can be accomplished in a sprint. Adjust your deadlines accordingly. Remember to set a high-bar, but keep it realistic. Under-promise and over-deliver. Always. This fuels a team’s sense of accomplishment and avoids overwhelming them.
* [ ] Write a brief team update for DALI PR
  * DALI fans want to hear about your project! Write a 1-paragraph blurb for the DALI newsletter and/or website about your project thus far. Could talk about your process, your ideas, project goals, why is the project important, etc.

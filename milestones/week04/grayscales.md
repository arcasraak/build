Using the sketches, start to digitize and add fidelity. Grayscales™ are *GRAY*. Think about function first and leave out any visual treatments to not waste time.

Benefits:
  * understand structure while it's early
  * plan and prepare for the content
  * set the framework to get feedback early on

Rules:
  * Iterate. Never settle for your first solution.
  * Refer back to your research for inspiration.
  * Include real-ish content wherever possible.
    * The more realistic the content, the more intelligent you can be with design decisions.
    * Make up and synthesize words you think are good enough (no Lorem Ipsum).
  * Don’t waste any time making it pretty.
    * Use a basic font, three shades of gray, and boxes for image/video placeholders.
  * Create states for just the basic pages.
    * Complex states of those screens can come later in high-fidelity mockups.


## Tasks
* Create Grayscales for each main screen
* Get feedback from your partner and narrow down your designs
* Link together a Prototype in Figma - ready for user testing

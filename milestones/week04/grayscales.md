Once you have feedback from your partner on your sketches, start to *narrow down your designs and add detail*.

Grayscales™ are *GRAY*. Leave out any color or any visual treatments, because ideas still can be scrapped and started again. We don’t want to waste any time with making it pretty.

Prepare to **iterate** as you determine the best way to display information, work through a flow, or integrate content. Refer back to your Competitive/Comparative for inspiration and interface examples.


## Guidelines:  
* **Design for each unique page.** Multiple states of those pages can come later in visual design.
* Use a design tool like Sketch or Figma to make prototyping faster (yay copy-paste and versioning!). Use Craft with Sketch or the Prototyping tab in Figma to connect pages.
* Work side by side the other designer or pick a specific feature set to design when working independently. Communicate often to keep your designs moving along evenly.

### Content:
* Mid-fidelity Grayscales™ should include real-ish content wherever possible (don’t let a content problem hold you back from more designing, but the more realistic the content, the more intelligent you can be with design decisions). DO NOT USE Lorem Ipsum. This leads to space mis-estimation. Make up and synthesize your own content, it is ok to make mistakes on this just put down words you think are good enough.
* DO NOT worry yet about fonts, colors, grid systems, or design elements (i.e. use a basic font like Avenir, three shades of gray, and boxes for images or video placeholders)

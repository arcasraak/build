Now that you have your functionality mapped out let’s start on planning the coding.

## Scaffolding

You now have the features all planned out. How do you want to build it? Plan out what technology you think you want to use and let’s get some code scaffolding ready.

You should get some basics of your project up and running. If your project as a UI try to do a little layout so that you have a main component and a hello world for the frontend and a hello world from the backend. If you have an idea of any modules and libraries you are planning on using, document them and or get them installed in your repos. At this point you should have your project code started and ready to work on. The frameworks should be set up and running and a local development environment set up for everybody on the team.

The idea is that by the end of this you have your starter code pushed and everybody on your team has a local development environment set up and can contribute.

## Readme

In your project’s main README.md file (you may have multiple repos, but for now just use the repo you’ll be using for whatever is ending up being the frontend) start to outline the tech stack you will using. As you work on the project your README.md file will be a record of the tools you are using and how to get your dev environment running.

Start this doc now:
```

# Project Name

TODO: short project description, some sample screenshots or mockups

## Architecture

TODO:  descriptions of code organization and tools and libraries used

## Setup

TODO: how to get the project dev environment up and running, npm install etc

## Deployment

TODO: how to deploy the project

## Authors

TODO: list of authors

## Acknowledgments
```

You don’t have to fill in the whole document for this milestone, but do start on it and fill in what you can. This README is for now the defacto "landing page" for your project. It should be kept up-to-date so that anybody can clone your repos and run your project dev environment.

Note: using github will be an essential part of how you will work together.  You are required to use git flow — i.e. use branches and [pull requests](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/) as you work together. You don’t necessarily need to do code reviews, but doing git flow with feature branches will help you organize your team and your code.

## Data Models

This is also a good time to plan out some of your data models. Consider what data you need for your project and figure out some of the fields and objects. You don't need to create a full relational model, but do consider what your data should look like. Describe the objects you think you will need (an informal schema for your data). Create a Wiki page with the data models you plan out.  Start a [github wiki page](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/) on this in your github repo and keep it updated.

## GitHub Issues

Use GitHub issues properly.  This is the #1 predictor of project success. If a team manages their tasks well they will make progress and have something to show at the end of the term.  If they don't — no matter how well you think the team gets along or has productive meetings, things just won't have the same velocity or productivity.

❓ When should you use GitHub issues?<br>
✅ ALWAYS!

❓ What is the right scope for an issue?<br>
✅ You can think of issues as individual tasks: "create login button",  "api endpoint for user profile", etc.  Issues can also be bugs that you find along the way.  Break up large tasks into individual smaller ones, each one should be under a few hours of work.  The smaller the tasks the actually faster you will work (not just the appearance of speed). It is easier to take on a manageable scope issue and work through it than if the issue has multiple steps that quickly become overwhelming to think through.

❓ Should I assign my teammates to issues?<br>
✅ Yes! You should assign people to each issue as you work on them so your team knows who is doing what. Feel free to assign each other tasks, a little aggressiveness is ok!

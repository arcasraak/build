How has your research changed the scope, scale, or implementation of the proposed solution?

This is a document outlining statement of purpose, stakeholders, proposed solution, & timeline.

Project Proposals must be pitched by your group to the DALI Staff before submission to the partner. Proposals are iterative (in response to staff & partner feedback) & required before moving to the next step.

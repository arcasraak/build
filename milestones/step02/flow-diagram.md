Now that you have determined the needs of the user and the possible features that could address these needs, you can start to lace together a flow.

A flow diagram documents the tasks the user will perform, in relation to each other and over time. Take care to show the entire experience. Where a task splits, mark one outcome as Y for “Yes” and the other as N for “No”.

Create main flows for the primary tasks. Add alternate flows for cases that are less common, but still occur. Think hard about any edge cases that are rare, but need to be designed for and built.

MVP demos and testing of the projects for this term.  The main focus will be on getting user feedback.  You are welcome to invite friends, there will be food!

Please show up early to set up your table (remember we could have had a final instead!).  The event will be science fair style - you will have a table with your project name and either a screen or a stand for a laptop to better demo your awesome projects.

The focus is on demo-ing and getting feedback. Have a feedback form ready and ask questions.

Be prepared to verbally
* Motivate the idea
* Show it in action
* Discuss challenges
* Ask for feedback

There will be voting and prizes for best demos!

At this stage you should have rudimentary functionality in place. For instance if you were building a web or mobile app there should be frontend components hitting api endpoints that are pulling data from the database. You should have all the components/views planned out and started in code even if they are simple placeholders. You should be at the point where you have some of your presentational components (UI) laid out and have started on wiring things together with any data sources such as your api server (or computational/algorithmic logic depending on your project).

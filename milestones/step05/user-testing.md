Once youâ€™re about 80% complete with creating the Mockups, take a pause to test it, preferably with different users than the ones you first tested. Be sure to connect any new elements in the prototype and check that all the previous links are still accurate.

Follow previous [User Testing protocol](../step03/rapid-user-testing.md) for this round.

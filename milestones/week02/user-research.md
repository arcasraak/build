Uncover the user needs and pain points, ultimately helping you design for the user.

Benefits:
  * moves from "assumptions" to "observations"
  * creates genuine insights into user problems

Techniques:
  * Interview: This can be 1 on 1 or a small group of users. The smaller the environment, the more likely they are to share antidotes.
  * Survey: For a larger sample, and anonymous responses.
  * Ask the partner: They know their target user, and might have some people already available to contact.
  * Workshop: For an extra challenge (and a fun time!), consider conducting a “Co-Creation” Workshop and invite the users to discuss and solve their own problems.

### Tasks:
  * Determine your user types
  * Identify users for interview that fit these types
  * Draft a questioning guide
    * Copy this [User Research + Testing Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gKQyrXQKgv_zLd7S20WOh8IB6I9i2WX_XkQ5Kq0MYDk/edit?usp=sharing) to your team Drive and populate with your questions. The *first tab* is for User Research and the *second tab* is for User Testing.
  * Conduct 2 interviews each. Restrict yourself from asking leading questions and take detailed notes.

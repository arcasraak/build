## Overview
To get ready to build your project and to stretch your coding muscles we're going to spend a week to play with a potential technology that you are considering using for this project. If you might want to build a webapp that uses video or an ios app that uses accelerometer, etc, build a small test of that technology.  You are welcome to use this time to try your hand at coding in a framework related to your project, for instance React if you want to build a webapp, or Unity3D if you want to play with game stuff, etc.  If you've never coded in a particular technology now would be the time to try it out before you start working on a full project without feeling like you have to commit.


## Team

This is best done individually - every developer choosing a different technology to explore.

## Build

Choose some technology and build a thing.  This can be as simple as finding a good tutorial and following it or get your hands dirty with a problem that is related to your project and try to see if you can get it working.  For instance, you think you want to build a webapp where image uploading will be an integral part. For this you could get a standalone page up that has image uploading.  Or if you think your product will be an iOS app but you've never coded one, for this you could follow an online tutorial to get a sample iOS app up and running.  The goal is to have a bit of time to play with some technologies and gain a bit of comfort with the potential options that you are considering for your project.

## GitHub

You should use this opportunity to use github to host your repository.  Create a repo in your own github account  should make sure you have github set up with your [correct github email](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/) so that your commits are recognized as belonging to you.  Make sure you have at least 1 commit connected to your github email on this.

## Tutorials

If you follow a tutorial or two just remember to acknowledge this fact in your README file. See the [DALI Dev Resources](https://github.com/dali-lab/dev-resources) repo for ideas.

## README

All your projects on github should include a README.md file.  For this milestone all it needs is:

* [ ] Short description of what you attempted to build
* [ ] What you learned
* [ ] What didn't work

## Sharing

We'll share what we've learned during the next lab meeting!

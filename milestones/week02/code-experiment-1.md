## Overview

This is similar to last week's [Code Experiment 0](../week02/code-experiment-0.md).  However now that you have played around with a technology - you should compare notes with the rest of your team and choose a technology to keep working on (if none of the options was pleasing then pivot and choose something new).  The idea is to keep going in a direction you have identified and specifically try out certain features that you might need for the project.  For example, if there is a specific display component such as a spider graph that you aren't sure how to make - try to isolate it and build just that in your chosen technology.


## Team

Depending on how many features you'd like to play with you could do this either as a whole team on 1 harder issue or play around with several.  You should try to share a codebase for this experiment though.

## GitHub

This is also a time to figure out how to use git flow.  You are required to use git flow with feature branch style [pull requests](https://yangsu.github.io/pull-request-tutorial/).   At this point create a repo and add everybody as collaborators.  Practice git flow by creating feature branches and using pull requests rather than pushing to master directly.  Make sure each member on your team has issued a pull request and had it approved (anybody on your team can approve).

Reminder: You should make sure you have github set up with your [correct github email](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-your-email-in-git/) so that your commits are recognized as belonging to you.

## README

All your projects on github should include a README.md file.  For this milestone all it needs is:

* [ ] Short description of what you attempted to build
* [ ] Who did what
* [ ] What you learned
* [ ] What didn't work

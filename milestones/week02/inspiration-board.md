Develop your InVision Board to include a section for inspiration. Look at art, digital products, and the environment for inspiration - even if it does not directly relate to the problem at hand (e.g. interesting form, landing page UI, etc.). Benefits of an Inspiration Board:
* Awareness of design trends 
* Cross-discipline approach
* Discovery of potential features not yet introduced in competitive solutions

## Second Term Project Milestones

### Dev:
QA review showed code needs more work:
* [ ] Work with your PM and Core Mentor to determine the scope. Identify a week number by which you stop addressing fixes and start working on new design work. Keep in mind “Technical Debt”: How much time spent fixing little bugs before the project needs to be redesigned.

QA review showed no additional work necessary:
* [ ] Follow Term 1 Milestones

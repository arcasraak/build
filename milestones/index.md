## First Term Project Milestones

*Milestone weeks run from Wednesday to Wednesday*

<br>
**First Wednesday Meeting**: Welcome DALI! Kickoff Week 1

[**Week 1: Kick-off Meeting**](week01/)<br>
Work with your partner and team to understand the problem, stakeholder and partner requirements, and the project scope.


[**Week 2: Research and Code Experiment**](week02/)<br>
Interview users to understand their problem, and create personas. Conduct code experiment 0.


[**Week 3: Define, Feature Spec, Code Experiments**](week03/)<br>
Define the core features and sketch those features as a team. Present sketched options to your partner for feedback and a design direction. Conduct code experiment 1.


[**Week 4: Grayscales™, User Testing, Code Scaffolding**](week04/)<br>
Create Grayscales™ for the main screens. Conduct rapid user testing to validate design solutions. Setup initial code scaffolding with tools and frameworks chosen.


[**Week 5: Style Guide, Rudimentary Functionality**](week05/)<br>
Settle on a style guide and apply to all screens, including insights gained from user testing. Connect all necessary code components together. Rudimentary functionality in place and components are connected and exchange data.


[**Week 6: Refine and Functionality**](week06/)<br>
Refine designs and have basic functionality in place.


[**Week 7: Add Delight, Bughunt**](week07/)<br>
Solidify designs and add in delightful features and interactions. Focus on function over form to get MVP functionality complete. Participate in a bughunt. Help other teams find bugs in the demos!


[**Week 8: Design and Bug Fixes**](week08/)<br>
Final visual sweep of all pages for consistency. Iterate fixing bugs from bug-hunt.


[**Week 9: Technigala and Handoff**](week09/)<br>
The Technigala is science fair style, open to public. Show off your demos and collect + document user feedback. Complete Handoff documentation including packaged files, style archive, and demo video.

## Second Term Project Milestones

### Everyone:
* [ ] Work through First Term Week 1 Milestones
* Planning Meeting:
  * [ ] Self reflection (what are your goals)
  * [ ] Review previous term’s handoff document
  * [ ] Get familiar with the documents, Drive folder, design files
  * [ ] Incorporate feedback and user testing from previous term into a cohesive doc and keep handy for Feature Spec in Week 3.
* QA review:
  * [ ] Review any outstanding issues in Git
  * [ ] Is anything broken? Report new bugs in Git
  * [ ] Does the code look like the designs? Mark inconsistencies in Git

### Dev:
QA review showed code needs more work:
* [ ] Work with your PM and Core Mentor to determine the scope. Identify a week number by which you stop addressing fixes and start working on new design work. Keep in mind “Technical Debt”: How much time spent fixing little bugs before the project needs to be redesigned.

QA review showed no additional work necessary:
* [ ] Follow Term 1 Milestones

### Des:
Follow Term 1 Milestones with these additions:

Week 2
* Current Product Audit:
  * [ ] Conduct a review of the previous design work. Get familiar with the design flow, file, and features. Especially in preparation for Rapid User Testing.
* User Research with User Testing:
  * [ ] After conducting the user research, keep the users and conduct additional rapid user testing of the previous designs (follow [Rapid User Testing](rapid-user-testing.md) for guidelines)

Week 3
* [ ] Determine features that can be added. Build instead of rebuild, and be careful not to scrap other work just because it's easier.

Overall, substitute any "extra" time (not needing a new style guide for example) with additional higher fidelity prototyping and user testing of new features.

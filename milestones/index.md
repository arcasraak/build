## First Term Project Milestones

* [**Step 0: Welcome, Kick-off Meeting**](step00/):<br>
In Step 0, work with your partner and team to understand the problem, stakeholder and partner requirements, and the project scope.

* [**Step 1: Research and Code Experiment**](step01/):<br>
Take time in Step 2 to research products and users, and create personas. Conduct code experiment 1.

* [**Step 2: Define, Feature Spec, Code Experiements**](step02/):<br>
Define the core components of your project, create a walk-through of your project from the user perspective, and develop lightweight sketches of critical features. Continue dev experiments.

* [**Step 3: Greyscales, Code Scaffolding**](step03/):<br>
Create grayscales for each main interaction and screen, and conduct rapid user testing to validate design solutions. Setup initial code scaffolding with tools and frameworks chosen.

* [**Step 4: Style Guide, Rudimentary Functionality**](step04/):<br>
Settle on a style guide and apply to all screens, including insights gained from user testing. Connect all necessary code components together. Rudimentary functionality in place and components are connected and exchange data.

* [**Step 5: More Testing and Functionality**](step05/):<br>
Second round of user testing and have basic functionality in place.

* [**Step 6: Delight, Dog-Fooding**](step06/):<br>
Solidify designs from testing and add in delightful features and interactions. Focus on function over form to get MVP functionality complete. Start internal QA testing (dog-fooding) with a buddy team.

* [**Step 7: MVP and Bughunt**](step07/):<br>
Finish MVP functionality and participate in a bughunt. Help other teams find bugs in the demos!

* [**Step 8: Design Docs and Bug Fixes**](step08/):<br>
Create design documentation such as style guides and demo videos. Iterate fixing bugs from bug-hunt.

* [**Step 9: DEMOS and User Feedback**](step09/):<br>
MVP demos and testing of the projects for this term. The main focus will be on getting user feedback. Science fair style. Open to public.

## Competitive Research
Before any designing happens, it’s critical to first understand what similar products exist, and how they work.

Competitive products solve a similar problem. Benefits of Competitive Research:
  * Builds domain knowledge (become a SME “subject matter expert”)
  * Identification of best practices
  * Avoid “reinventing the wheel”
  * Learn from other’s mistakes
  * Design for competitive advantage (find a better implementation)

As you find examples (your partner might have offered some Competitive examples for you in the Kickoff Meeting), take screenshots and annotate them in an [InVision Board](https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205249269-Introduction-to-Boards). This will double as a place to return to if you feel stuck, stale, or uninspired. Be sure to invite contributions from everyone.

Share your InVision board in your Slack Channel.

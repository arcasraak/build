## Competitive Research
Before any designing happens, it’s critical to first understand what similar products exist, and how they work. Creating a single source for this information will work as a place to return to if you feel stuck, stale, or uninspired.

Competitive products solve a similar problem.

Benefits of Competitive Research:
  * Builds domain knowledge (become a SME “subject matter expert”)
  * Identification of best practices
  * Avoid “reinventing the wheel”
  * Learn from other’s mistakes
  * Design for competitive advantage (find a better implementation)

#### Tasks
  * [ ] Take screenshots of your competitive research and post them to your team's InVision Board. Your partner might have offered some examples as well.
  * [ ] Leave a comment on each example with what works/doesn't.



## Term 2 Additions:

* Current Product Audit:
  * [ ] Conduct a review of the previous design work. Get familiar with the design flow, file, and features. Especially in preparation for Rapid User Testing next week.

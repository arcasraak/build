## Competitive Research
Competitive products solve a similar problem.

Before any designing happens, it’s critical to first understand what similar products exist, and how they work.


Benefits of Competitive Research:
  * Builds domain knowledge (become a SME “subject matter expert”)
  * Identification of best practices
  * Avoid “reinventing the wheel”
  * Learn from other’s mistakes
  * Design for competitive advantage (find a better implementation)

#### Create a single source for this information
  * [ ] Take screenshots of your competitive research and post them to your team's InVision Board. Your partner might have offered some examples as well.
  * [ ] Leave a comment on each example with what works/doesn't.

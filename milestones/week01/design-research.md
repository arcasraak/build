### Competitive research
Before any designing happens, it’s critical to first understand what similar products exist, and how they work.

Benefits:
  * Builds domain knowledge (become a SME “subject matter expert”)
  * Identification of best practices
  * Avoid “reinventing the wheel”
  * Learn from other’s mistakes
  * Design for competitive advantage (find a better implementation)



### Inspirational research
Inspiration can be digital products or other any other artistic or natural form - even if it does not directly relate to the problem at hand.

Benefits:
  * Awareness of design trends
  * Cross-discipline approach
  * Discovery of potential features not yet introduced in competitive solutions
  * A resource to turn to when needing inspiration!


## Tasks:
  * Take screenshots of your research and post them to your team's Figma project page "Week 1". Your partner might have offered some ideas as well - document these.
  * Leave a comment on each example with what works/doesn't.
  * At your next meeting with your partner - show the research and discuss. Use this as fuel for your future design work.

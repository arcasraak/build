Expand your InVision Board to include a section for **inspiration**.

Look at art, digital products, other design forms, and the environment for inspiration - even if it does not directly relate to the problem at hand.


Benefits of an Inspiration Board:
* Awareness of design trends
* Cross-discipline approach
* Discovery of potential features not yet introduced in competitive solutions
* A resource to turn to when needing inspiration!


At your next meeting with your partner - show the inspiration board and discuss. Observe how they respond and what they like or dislike. Use this as fuel for your future design work.

Setting your team up for success is 75% prep work (keep in mind that 93% of statistics are invented on the spot). There’s a lot to do to get ready for the term, but starting off on the right foot will make everything run more smoothly

## Meet Your Team
Good team dynamics are super important. Temptation is to blow through the ‘soft stuff,’ but take the time to do it right.

  * **Do something fun or get a meal together**
  * **Get to know everyone’s strengths, weaknesses, and interests**
  * **Establish norms for meetings and team culture**
      * Establishing expectations from the get-go gets everyone on the same page and mitigates conflicts. Some options for how frame this conversation
  * **Set long-term goals for the team**
      * Set SMAT goals: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Timely (I find the typical R repetitive)
      * Can be project related, e.g. Launch the camera feature by February 12, or team related, e.g. Always show up on time to meetings.
      * Set individual goals before the next team meeting.
  * **[Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/dali-lab/dali-internal/boards?repos=72027408) Onboarding**
  * **Select weekly meeting times**
    * Your team is required to meet for at least 3 hrs per week. Many teams have found that meeting for two different 1.5 hr periods is kindest to everyone’s schedules and an advantage to have multiple check-ins throughout the week.
    * Set up your meeting times ASAP. This is the biggest blocker to getting a team moving. If the team’s schedules are in chaos because of adding/dropping classes, at least establish meeting times for the next week or two.
    * Use [when2meet.com](https://www.when2meet.com/) to coordinate everyone’s schedules. Everyone should input ALL their available time (i.e. don’t mark ‘busy’ during desired nap times).
  * **Project Briefing**
    * Discuss the project with your team: Important to do some deep thinking about the project before meeting with the partner to come with your own ideas and opinions. Everyone should come prepared by re-reading existing partner communication/application (found in the Drive).
      * Based on this current understanding of the problem and project, what do you see as solutions?
      * What would you keep/change?
      * What questions do you have for the partner?

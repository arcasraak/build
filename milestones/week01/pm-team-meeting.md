title: PM Prep for Initial Team Meeting
published: true
---

Setting your team up for success is 75% prep work (keep in mind that 93% of statistics are invented on the spot). There’s a lot to do to get ready for the term, but starting off on the right foot will make everything run more smoothly

## Plan ahead
What are your goals for this meeting? How are you going to accomplish everything? Prepare your team for the meeting – what do they need to know going into it?

## Meet Your Team
Good team relationships are super important. Everyone won’t be best friends overnight (nor do they ever need to be), but spending time on getting to know each other communicates that team dynamics matter, individuals matter, and that alone accomplishes half the battle. Temptation is to blow through the ‘soft stuff,’ but take the time to do it right.

  * **Do something fun together or get a meal**
      * Going on an adventure, solving a tangible problem, getting a meal all serve to share a team experience that is focused on your team as humans, not as developers or designers (that will come later). The goal is to establish a comfortable, family-esque feeling within the team. Remember that healthy (and fun!) team dynamics are key to team success. Imagine delivering bad news to someone – would you rather be talking to someone you already have good rapport with, or barely know? <!-- Links to team dynamics articles, team building -->
      * This is where you really get to be creative. What would make a fun team memory? What questions can you ask to get the team beyond the classic ‘small talk’ questions and into meaningful conversation?

  * **Get to know everyone’s strengths, weaknesses, and interests**
      * Your team should be able to support each other. How can you do so if you don’t know what areas they need support in and who is best to provide that support? Start by being honest yourself about what you don’t know/struggle with/are really good at/what kind of things you love and the team will likely follow suit.

  * **Establish norms for meetings and team culture**
      * Establishing expectations from the get-go gets everyone on the same page and mitigates conflicts. Some options for how frame this conversation:
          1. Have everyone think of a few [meeting norms](https://hbr.org/2016/06/8-ground-rules-for-great-meetings) they would like to see established on this team. Come with your own ideas as well and work with the team to choose which you can all agree to and would like to implement this term.
            * [Ideas for norms](https://medium.com/enspiral-tales/5-tips-for-making-better-decisions-with-your-team-20357719e9b1):
              * Agree to start and end on time
              * 24-hour notice of an absence
              * Preparing, sending, and reading meeting agenda #hrs ahead of the meeting
              * Everyone’s voice should be heard (literally) at least # times during a meeting
              * Everyone has the power to move the meeting along if a topic is taking longer than the prescribed amount
              * No side conversations
              * Stack phones in the middle of the table until the end. First person to reach for their phone has to buy coffee for everyone
          2. Have everyone think about a successful team they’ve been a part of in the past and what they valued about that experience (tease out specifics). Then talk about what everyone wants this team to look like. Finish by writing a Community (or, Team) Contract that everyone agrees to.


  * **Set long-term goals for the team**
      * Set [SMAT goals](https://www.hnfs.com/content/dam/hnfs/tn/common/pdf/Wellness%20Program%20Materials/HealthyWeighsforLife/PF1112x051WritingSmartGoals.pdf): Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Timely (I find the typical R repetitive)
      * Can be project related, e.g. Launch the camera feature by February 12, or team related, e.g. Always show up on time to meetings.
      * Give everyone homework to set their individual goals. Share these at the next team meeting (make sure they are SMAT goals!). You’ll meet with everyone during week 5 to mark their progress.

* **Introduce everyone to [Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/dali-lab/dali-internal/boards?repos=72027408)**
	* Decide which pipelines you will use.
	* Define ‘done’/ talk about how important it is to define done for each issue.
	* This tool is hugely important to team organization, but you can make this training fun! No one likes to be talked-at. Maybe create a treasure hunt in Zenhub that will educate them on the different Zenhub elements as they find the clues. Use your imagination!
  * Make sure everyone knows the expectation is that they use this for everything they work on.


* **Select weekly meeting times**
  * Your team is required to meet for at least 3 hrs per week. Many teams have found that meeting for two different 1.5 hr periods is kindest to everyone’s schedules and an advantage to have multiple check-ins throughout the week.
  * Set up your meeting times ASAP. This is the biggest blocker to getting a team moving. If the team’s schedules are in chaos because of adding/dropping classes, at least establish meeting times for the next week or two.
  * Use [when2meet.com](https://www.when2meet.com/) to coordinate everyone’s schedules. Everyone should input ALL their available time (i.e. don’t mark ‘busy’ during desired nap times).


* **Project Briefing**
  * Let staff know when you schedule this meeting so they can join at the end to pass off information and ideas about the project gathered as they interviewed partners!
  * Discuss the project with your team: Important to do some deep thinking about the project before meeting with the partner to come with your own ideas and opinions. Every one should come prepared by re-reading existing partner communication/application.
      * Based on this current understanding of the problem and project, what do you see as solutions?
      * What would you keep/change?
      * What questions do you have for the partner? Remember to write down the questions to prepare for the partner meeting!

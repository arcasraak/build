## Kickoff Meeting With Your Partner(s)

It's time to meet your partner! They’ve been asked to prepare a project briefing which should include things like market research, intended users, etc. Read the brief in preparation for the meeting and come prepared with questions. This is your opportunity to gather all the information your team needs to get started on the Discovery Phase. This meeting starts to set the tone for your partner meetings – be sure that everyone is participating.   

##### General Guidelines:
* ***[Discovery Phase Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/a/dali.dartmouth.edu/document/d/1h67qvdoGsG6_cjbUPn9kEtYm0dkY-QSVfp3fjPRsrNA/edit?usp=sharing)***: Use this as a guide for what questions the team should be asking your partner(s). Complete the worksheet as a team after the meeting.
2.	**Introductions**: Before you launch into the project, ask a little bit about the partner and introduces yourselves as well.
3.	**Take Detailed Notes**: Be sure to take good notes at this meetings, it may be an important to reference what was discussed.
4.	**Define the project scope**: Now that the team understands the project more, you can start to discuss scope with the partner. Let's say they ultimately want a website with 12 different elements. Talk with them to prioritize the most essential elements and decide what team will focus on this term.
This is an important step as over-promising or being unrealistic sets the team up for an overwhelming and unsatisfying experience.
5. **Follow Up**: DALI PM will follow up with the partner for any additional information, questions, or considerations.

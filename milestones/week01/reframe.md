## Reframe the Problem
During the first meeting, your partner presented your team with a problem. Your job is to uncover the real problem, the question that will drive you towards innovative, exciting, and impactful solutions.

Extracted from the [Discovery Phase Worksheet](https://docs.google.com/a/dali.dartmouth.edu/document/d/1h67qvdoGsG6_cjbUPn9kEtYm0dkY-QSVfp3fjPRsrNA/edit?usp=sharing):
  * State the problem in a single sentence. This forces you to hone in on the central issue you are addressing here.
  * Try to rephrase the problem statement (negative) as an opportunity (positive). Word it as a question beginning with, “How might we…?”
  * Reframe the question in at least 5 different ways to change the question fundamentally or imply a different solution set.
  * Reframe the question a few different ways to have a narrower scope (increase feasibility). Then reframe it to have a larger scope (increase potential impact).
  * Consider the geographic region you are working in/within. How does the geographic region affect the problem/question? How does it impact the possible solution set?
  * Consider the timeframe. How long do you see the question stretching out? Do you see it as a problem/question that could be addressed in the next few months? A year? A few decades?

## Prioritize. Sketch. Code experiment 1.

Define the core features and sketch those features as a team. Present sketched options to your partner for feedback and a design direction.


### Everyone:
  * Week 3
    * [ ] [Follow all steps in Week 3](../week03/)
  * Adding Features
    * Revisit the goals set in week 1.
    * Realign new features with these goals.
  * Build instead of rebuild
    * Be careful not to scrap other work just because it's easier!

## Welcome, Kick-off Meeting

In Week 1, work with your partner and team to understand the problem, stakeholder and partner requirements, and the project scope.

### Everyone:
  * Kickoff Week 1
    *   [Follow all steps in Week 1](../week01/)
  * Additions to First Team Meeting:
    *   [Self reflection](project-self-reflection.md) (what are your goals)
    *   Review previous term’s handoff document      
      *  Get familiar with the Drive folder, documents, code, and design files
    *   Incorporate feedback and user testing from previous term into a cohesive doc. Keep handy for Feature Spec in Week 3.
  * QA Review Meeting:
    *   Review any outstanding issues in Git
    *   Is anything broken? Report new bugs in Git
    *   Does the code look like the designs? Mark inconsistencies in Git
    * Prioritize these new issues, and work with your PM and Core Mentor to determine the Term 2 project scope.
    * Identify a week number by which Devs stop addressing fixes and start working on new Des work. Keep in mind “Technical Debt”: How much time spent fixing little bugs before the project needs to be redesigned.

### Des:
* In reviewing all the Term 1 Week 1 steps, consider what about the project has evolved and what has stayed the same. New members should go through the Term 1 Milestones and/or get familiar with the documents already completed such that they can contribute at the same level as continuing members. If this is the last term in lab, keep in mind that going through another cycle of design Milestones means that the developers also need to be ready for that amount of work. You might just have specific pages and states that need to get completed - and if that's the case, focus less on "new features" and more on a high quality hand-off.

* Current Product Audit:
  *   Conduct a review of the previous design work.
    * Get familiar with the design flow, file, and features.
    * Understand what problem the designers were solving, and where they left off.
    * Identify places you'd like to understand better, that you'd like to test in Rapid User Testing next week.

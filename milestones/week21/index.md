## Welcome, Kick-off Meeting

In Week 1, work with your partner and team to understand the problem, stakeholder and partner requirements, and the project scope.

### Everyone:
  * [ ] [follow steps in week1](../week01/)
  * Planning Meeting:
    * [ ] [Self reflection](project-self-reflection.md) (what are your goals)
    * [ ] Review previous term’s handoff document      
    * [ ] Get familiar with the documents, Drive folder, design files
    * [ ] Incorporate feedback and user testing from previous term into a cohesive doc and keep handy for Feature Spec in Week 3.
  * QA review:
    * [ ] Review any outstanding issues in Git
    * [ ] Is anything broken? Report new bugs in Git
    * [ ] Does the code look like the designs? Mark inconsistencies in Git


### Dev:
    QA review showed code needs more work:
    * [ ] Work with your PM and Core Mentor to determine the scope. Identify a week number by which you stop addressing fixes and start working on new design work. Keep in mind “Technical Debt”: How much time spent fixing little bugs before the project needs to be redesigned.

    QA review showed no additional work necessary:
    * [ ] Follow Term 1 Milestones

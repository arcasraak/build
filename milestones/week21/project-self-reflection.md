The second term for your projects is going to be awesome. Now comes the fun part. You have working products, all the setup work is done ‚Äî now you get to enjoy the fruits of your labors and add features, tweak and refine, make things look pretty, and ship the final product!

But right now is also a good time to work out the future direction of the project.  You have some feedback, some bug reports, now what?  

We'll start out the term with some self reflection about the project ‚Äî to try to incorporate feedback from user testing and consider any pivots etc.

As soon as you can you should have a team meeting and work through some of these questions.  This is a markdown worksheet template that you should copy into your project github wiki and fill out.  These are starting points for discussion with your team. Don't skimp on this.

## Project Term 2 Plan and Reflection Worksheet

## Original idea
*Revisit your original goals (check out your project proposal).*

#### What progress did you make towards your original MPV / on your stretch goals?

#### How is your project different from what you envisioned?

#### Most importantly, are you still happy with the direction that your project is headed?

#### What do you wish had gone differently / are there features you wish you hadn't made or made differently?

## Feedback
*What feedback from last term do you think is relevant and interesting to incorporate. List your feedback and label them with how they stack up for your vision.*

* [critical üî•]
* [stretch goal üç¶]
* [rejected ‚õî]

## Questions
*Think about where the project is headed.*

#### What are some questions that you/users have about direction/features/functionality that could use validation?

#### Think of ways that you might validate this: discussion with your team, advice from me, polling the class, asking users, and/or collecting and analyzing usage data. Write down some ideas here.

## Vision
*Refine your vision.*

#### How does the current feedback or user testing change how you think about the direction of the project?

#### If you were to consider a pivot or adjustment in what the product is, what would it be?

#### In an ideal world if you could build out your project to be anything without any constraints of time or skill what would you want to do? Dream big ‚Äî you can do more than you think. Try to push yourselves. You will be rewarded for trying something challenging.

#### Now write a mission statement for your project as you see it after all of this great brain activity. Just a few sentences suffices.

## How to get there
*Now that you've thought about where your project is headed and where you want it to go write down how might approach getting there.*

#### What are your next steps?

## Overview

In Step 0, work with your partner and team to understand the problem, stakeholder and partner requirements, and the project scope.

* Everyone:
  * [ ] [Brief yourself](#brief-yourself)
  * [ ] [Kickoff meeting](#kickoff-meeting)
  * [ ] [Reframe the problem](#reframe-the-problem)
  * [ ] [Competitive/Comparative Research](#competitivecomparative-research)


## Brief Yourself
Review the DALI Partner Information Form (an email from Staff)

## Kickoff Meeting
Meet with your partner as a team and complete this worksheet together.
DALI Staff and your group’s mentor must be invited to your initial partner meeting.

I. Understand the Partner’s Vision
Your partner may not know what the best solution is, but they will likely have some idea of what they’d like. Ask about the problem and what they have in mind, but keep an open mind to all solutions.

* Who makes up your team? Who is the primary contact person?
* What problem are you looking to address? Has anyone else solved this problem?
* What does success look like for this project? What are your goals?
* What feelings are important for your solution to evoke in users? (safety, comfort,
fun, etc.)
* Partner’s idea of solution (if applicable):


II. Identify Users

* Who are the users of your project? Identify at least two types.
* What are their particular needs and challenges?


III. Communication

* DALI PMs send weekly email updates to partners updating our progress. How else
would you like to communicate (skype, in-person), and with what frequency?
* Do you have all the content needed for the project? If there is data, can you
provide us with a means to access it? How will content be accessed in the future?


IV. Communication
* DALI PMs will follow up for any additional information, questions, or considerations. Make note of them and who will providing that information.

## Reframe the Problem
During the first meeting, your partner presented your team with a problem. Your job is to uncover the real problem, the question that will drive you towards innovative, exciting, and impactful solutions.

* State the problem in a single sentence. This forces you to hone in on the central issue you are addressing here.
* Try to rephrase the problem statement (negative) as an opportunity (positive). Word it as a question beginning with, “How might we…?”
* Reframe the question in at least 5 different ways to change the question fundamentally or imply a different solution set.
* Reframe the question a few different ways to have a narrower scope (increase feasibility). Then reframe it to have a larger scope (increase potential impact).
* Consider the geographic region you are working in/within. How does the geographic region affect the problem/question? How does it impact the possible solution set?
* Consider the timeframe. How long do you see the question stretching out? Do you see it as a problem/question that could be addressed in the next few months? A year? A few decades?



## Competitive/Comparative Research
Before any designing happens, it’s critical to first understand what similar products exist, and how they work.

**Competitive** is a product that solves a similar problem. Benefits of Competitive research:
* Builds domain knowledge (become a SME “subject matter expert”)
* Identification of best practices
* Avoid “reinventing the wheel”
* Learn from other’s mistakes
* Design for competitive advantage (find a better implementation)

**Comparative** is a product that may be used for inspiration despite it not directly relating to the problem at hand (e.g. interesting landing page, noteable UI, etc.). Benefits of Comparative research:
* Awareness of UX and UI trends
* Cross-discipline approach
* Discovery of potential features not yet introduced in competitive solutions  

As you find examples (your partner might have offered some Competitive examples for you in the Kickoff Meeting), take screenshots and annotate them in an [InVision Board](https://support.invisionapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/205249269-Introduction-to-Boards). This will double as a place to return to if you feel stuck, stale, or uninspired. Be sure to invite contributions from everyone.

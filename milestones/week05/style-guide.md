The earlier you settle on a style guide, the better, since this is the document that determines the look and feel of the project. Decide on color, fonts, and grid before applying them to your High Fidelity Mockups. Continue to update as you make final decisions in context.

* [Grids](https://www.slideshare.net/huer1278ft/grids-are-good-right) are your friend
  * Spacing and Padding: set a system for how far apart each element is from the next

* Color:
  * 60-30-10 Rule: 60% is your dominant color, 30% is secondary, and 10% is for the accent.
  * Be extra careful of color contrast when choosing a [Dark Theme](https://dribbble.com/erikdkennedy/buckets/160688-Dark-themes)
  * Never use pure black
  * [Gradients](uigradients.com)

* Typography:
  * Read up on the [basics](https://practicaltypography.com/typography-in-ten-minutes.html) and [details](http://jessicahische.is/talkingtype) of using type
  * Be cautious about mixing Serif (Formal, Old, Wise, Classy) with San Serif (Modern, Simple, Clean)
  * Font Kits
    * [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - The largest repository of completely free fonts in the world (best for web!)
    * [Typekit](https://typekit.com/) - Adobe's font service, free with an Adobe Creative Cloud account


If you're creating a [Design System](https://blog.prototypr.io/design-system-ac88c6740f53), refer to guides from existing systems for help.

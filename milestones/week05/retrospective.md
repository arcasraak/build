* Halfway through the term. Time for a formal check-in with the team.
* Retrospectives are similar to post-mortems but before the project ends. This is a chance to reflect on the project and teamwork thus far and see what is going well/where there is room for improvement.
* There are different methods for conducting Retrospectives. One way is for everyone to take several sticky notes and write down items that would fall under: good, okay, and room for improvement. Collect all the post-its and have someone read them all aloud without comment. As this happens have someone else categorize them. Everyone votes for 2-3 topics theyâ€™d like to discuss by putting a dot on the stickies. Set the number of votes. You may not get to every category, but your discussion on a few issues will be more productive.
* Remember that it is important to identify strengths/things that are going well.
* After the meeting, be sure to follow-up on any issues raised.

Time to put your concepts to the test! Use InVision or Figma Prototype mode to keep it as real as possible for the user.

**Mandatory dry run** with someone in the lab. Come by anytime and ask someone to user test. Record that person's name and answers in your testing notes document.

Now, update your questions and/or prototype if you had issues, and find a minimum of 3 users that closely fit your Personas.

## Preparation:
Within your design tool, **build your prototype** by connecting frames via nodes (in [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), use [Craft Prototype](https://vimeo.com/217893619) and upload your flow to [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/)). Give the prototype (on Do Not Disturb) to your user to interact with while you observe. Better yet, have a link ready that you can share with them - and have users test on their OWN devices. It helps them act more naturally, with more confidence.

## Use this Template
To make your life easier, the Design Resident made a [User Research + User Testing Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gKQyrXQKgv_zLd7S20WOh8IB6I9i2WX_XkQ5Kq0MYDk/edit?usp=sharing) for you. Copy the sheet to your Drive and populate with your specific questions. Use the *second tab* for User Testing.


## User Testing Tips:
* Set the tone
  * tell the user that this is a prototype, so not everything is working
  * assure the user that they are only helping by giving frank feedback
  * prompt the user to think out loud and describe what they would expect to happen before they act
  * introduce important details like the scenario so the user can be in the correct mindset (e.g. “You are hungry and in a new city…” )
* Prompts
  * let the user explore but prompt if they ignored something important (e.g. “what do you think this [point to an element you want to test] is/does?”)
  * be sure to ask a lot of WHY (some users will say “I don’t like the filters”, and you will need to probe to uncover more detailed feedback)
  * don’t provide solutions or assumptions on the spot
* Take notes
  * if the user didn’t interact with something and/or needed prompting, make a note
  * document any questions they ask or moments when they are confused
  * it’s difficult to take notes while also conducting the interview, therefore it’s best to **conduct interviews in pairs** and take turns with asking the questions or taking the notes.

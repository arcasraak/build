Ask the users themselves about the initial experience. Challenge your assumptions and clarify user needs.

Benefits:
* Catch possible issues with the designs
* Incorporate the needs of the users

Rules:
* Give the prototype (on Do Not Disturb) to your user to interact with while you observe **OR** have a link ready to share and have the users test on their OWN devices (it helps them act more naturally).
* Set the tone
  * tell the user that this is a prototype, so not everything is working
  * assure the user that they are only helping by giving frank feedback
  * prompt the user to think out loud and describe what they would expect to happen before they act
  * introduce important details like the scenario so the user can be in the correct mindset (e.g. “You are hungry and in a new city…” )
* Prompts
  * let the user explore but prompt if they ignored something important (e.g. “what do you think this [point to an element you want to test] is/does?”)
  * be sure to ask a lot of WHY (some users will say “I don’t like the filters”, and you will need to probe to uncover more detailed feedback)
  * don’t provide solutions or assumptions on the spot
* Take notes
  * if the user didn’t interact with something and/or needed prompting, make a note
  * document any questions they ask or moments when they are confused
  * it’s difficult to take notes while also conducting the interview, therefore it’s best to **conduct interviews in pairs** and take turns with asking the questions or taking the notes.


## Tasks
  * Use this [User Testing Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gKQyrXQKgv_zLd7S20WOh8IB6I9i2WX_XkQ5Kq0MYDk/edit?usp=sharing) to prepare your questions and record your findings.
    * The *second tab* is for User Testing. Copy the sheet to your Drive and populate with your specific questions.
  * **Mandatory dry run** with someone in the lab.
    * Record that person's name and answers in your testing notes document.
  * Update your questions and/or prototype from the dry run
  * Test a minimum of 3 users that closely fit your Personas

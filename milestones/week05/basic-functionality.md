At this stage you have completed data and component wiring and any client-server functionality has at least been tested so that you can keep making progress now on adding critical functionality.

## Critical MVP

You should evaluate what the critical functionality of the project is.  Focus on this in your development.  Don't go for too much low hanging fruit.  Having a login page is **much less** important than having the real functionality of whatever it is that you are building. Often it is easier to think about the simpler things like a settings page or login rather than the potentially harder actual functionality - but at this point that is what you should focus on. If necessary hardcode things like auth until later - better to be able to test your functionality early.

## README.md

Make sure your README.md files are updated with the current installation and deployment instructions as well as any architecture changes.

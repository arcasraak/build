Use your Style Guide and the User Testing feedback to move ahead in creating High Fidelity Mockups. Be careful not to scrap everything from one confused user - use your own judgement to act on priority items that were common amongst a majority of your tested users.

[Read this Medium post when starting out](https://medium.com/@erikdkennedy/7-rules-for-creating-gorgeous-ui-part-1-559d4e805cda)

Use [symbols](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/04/symbols-sketch/) wherever possible to minimize work down the line when updating elements.

Elements to pay attention to in design:
* Alignment (mostly left aligned, unless you have a strong reason to deviate)
* Use of [shadows](https://material.io/guidelines/material-design/elevation-shadows.html)
* [Consistency](http://www.visualmess.com/)

* UI Elements:
  * Icons
    * Use open source libraries (like [entypo.com](http://www.entypo.com/)/ and [material.io/icons](https://material.io/icons/))
    * [Make your own](https://www.designcrispy.com/use-pen-tool-sketch-master-easy-steps/)
  * Photos
    * [Unsplash.com](unsplash.com) for free high quality photos
    * Provide your own

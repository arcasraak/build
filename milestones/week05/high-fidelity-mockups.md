Hurray! You've made it half way through the term. Now we can start adding visual detail to the pages. Follow these guidelines to help you get started.

Determine the *look and feel*:
1. **Pick one grayscale** that could be visually interesting.
2. Make **3 variations** of this page in Hi-Fidelity (UI design).
3. With your team and your partner, select one style that you like, refining as necessary.
4. Use the colors and fonts from this style and create a **style guide** based on that.
5. Continue to apply that style guide to all pages.

Use the **User Testing feedback** to iterate and *improve the designs*:
* Be careful not to scrap everything from one confused user - use your own judgment to act on priority items that were common amongst a majority of your tested users.
* Know that in moving to the UI phase of any project, you are progressing from "how it works" to "how it looks". Determining how something looks is quite subjective, and is an art. Take time to read these guides and principles before diving in, and trust that nothing ever looks amazing the first time around.

* UI Elements:

    * Use open source libraries (like [entypo.com](http://www.entypo.com/)/ and [material.io/icons](https://material.io/icons/))
    * [Make your own](https://www.designcrispy.com/use-pen-tool-sketch-master-easy-steps/)
  * Photos

    * Provide your own / from your partner

**A note on teamwork**: the more solid your style guide is, the better time you'll have in splitting up pages to divide and conquer. Don't be afraid to over-share your progress (especially half-baked ideas) to stay on the same page with the other designer(s).
  * Use shared symbols wherever possible to minimize work down the line when updating elements.

Hurray! You've made it half way through the term. Now we can start adding visual detail to the pages. Follow these guidelines to help you get started.

Determine the *look and feel*:
1. **Pick one grayscale** that could be visually interesting.
2. Make **3 variations** of this page in Hi-Fidelity (UI design).
3. With your team and your partner, select one style that you like, refining as necessary.
4. Use the colors and fonts from this style and create a **style guide** based on that.
5. Continue to apply that style guide to all pages.

Use the **User Testing feedback** to iterate and *improve the designs*:
* Be careful not to scrap everything from one confused user - use your own judgment to act on priority items that were common amongst a majority of your tested users.

Know that in moving to the UI phase of any project, you are progressing from "how it works" to "how it looks". Determining how something looks is quite subjective, and is an art. Take time to read these guides and principles before diving in, and trust that nothing ever looks amazing the first time around.

* UI Elements:
  * Icons
    * Use open source libraries (like [entypo.com](http://www.entypo.com/)/ and [material.io/icons](https://material.io/icons/))
    * [Make your own](https://www.designcrispy.com/use-pen-tool-sketch-master-easy-steps/)
  * Photos

    * Provide your own / from your partner


**Teamwork and Feedback**: the more solid your style guide is, the better time you'll have in splitting up pages to divide and conquer. Don't be afraid to over-share your progress (especially half-baked ideas) to stay on the same page with the other designer(s).

    1. Consolidate your designs into *ONE (1) Figma project*. This means one URL, one link, one source of truth for all designs and designers on the project. This will help with file management, comments, and with Zeplin.
      * Use shared symbols wherever possible to minimize work down the line when updating elements.
    2. Keep all process artboards in this Figma project - just make a note that it is *PROCESS* somewhere at the top of that area, and move it to the side. This will help you explain how you arrived at a solution, if asked about a particular approach.
    3. On the pages that you want to share and get feedback on, mark them with a *FOR FEEDBACK* section.
    4. Then next to or below each page you want feedback on, write a few comments to help the reviewer understand:
       * What you feel is working on this page / what you’re happy about :smile:
       * What you feel needs work on this page :flushed:
       * A question or two for another designer to help you with (can be UX or UI related) :thinking_face:
           * i.e. “I’m not sure if this is the best treatment of these elements” or “I can’t seem to find the right shade of green”
    5. When showing the work, use the “Play” feature (top right) to make the pages nice and large for your reviewer and then use the “*comment - C*” button (top left) to leave a specific note in a specific place

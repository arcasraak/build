Hurray! You've made it half way through the term. Now we can start progressing from "how it works" to "how it looks". Keep in mind:
* Determining how something looks is quite subjective, and is an art.
* Trust that nothing ever looks amazing the first time around. Do multiple revisions!


#### Determining the *look and feel*:
* [ ] **Pick one grayscale** that has most of the core functionality (likely the home page).
* [ ] Make **3 variations** of this page in Hi-Fidelity (UI design).
* [ ] With your team and your partner, select **one style** that you like, refining as necessary.
* [ ] Use the colors and fonts from this style and create a **style guide** based on that. The finalized style guide is due next week, but get started on it now to move forward in the process.
* [ ] Continue to apply the styles from the style guide to all pages.
* [ ] Use the **User Testing feedback** to iterate and *improve the designs*
  * Be careful not to scrap everything from one confused user - use your own judgment to act on priority items that were common amongst a majority of your tested users.
* [ ] Integrate designs with Zeplin
  * Learn how to use Zeplin with this [handy guide!](https://medium.com/dali-lab/a-guide-to-zeplin-9b1c0dbef0b1)
  * Create your one free [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) account and ask your PM to add you to your group project.
  * As soon as you get your first round of High Fidelity Mockups done, **upload them to your team project** for collaboration with Developers.

#### UI Principles:
  * Color
    * 60-30-10 Rule: 60% is your dominant color, 30% is secondary, and 10% is the accent.
    * Be extra careful of color contrast when choosing a [Dark Theme](https://dribbble.com/erikdkennedy/buckets/160688-Dark-themes)
    * Never use pure black
    * A nice [gradient finder](uigradients.com)

  * Typography
    * Start here on [learning font design](https://www.canva.com/learn/font-design/)
    * Read up on everything related to [typography](https://practicaltypography.com/)
    * Be cautious about mixing Serif (Formal, Old, Wise, Classy) with San Serif (Modern, Simple, Clean)
    * Find your font using Font Kits
      * [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - The largest repository of completely free fonts in the world
      * [Typekit](https://typekit.com/) - Adobe's font service, free with an Adobe Creative Cloud account
      * Determine the character sizes with the [Modular Scale](http://www.modularscale.com/)

  * Grids
    * [Grids](https://spec.fm/specifics/8-pt-grid) are most commonly made in multiples of 8 (because most devices are divisible by 8)
    * Full Width: A full-width design is edge-to-edge of the screen.
    * Floating: A floating design adheres to a fixed-width grid (typically centered).
    * Use this equation to determine the fixed-width grid: **(12 Columns x Column Width) + (11 Gutters x Gutter Width) = Total Layout Width**
    * Make sure your gutters and columns both divisible by 8.
      * NOTE: The default Nudge+Shift distance in Sketch is 10px. Not great when youâ€™re working on an 8px grid. Change that to 8px in preferences.
    * Spacing: use the same nudge increment for vertical spacing between elements.

  * Icons
    * Use open source libraries (like [entypo.com](http://www.entypo.com/)/ and [material.io/icons](https://material.io/icons/))
    * [Make your own](https://www.designcrispy.com/use-pen-tool-sketch-master-easy-steps/)

  * Photos
    * [Unsplash.com](unsplash.com) for free high-quality photos
    * Provide your own / from your partner

#### Designing for mobile:
  * It's great to actually see your work on the device! Download the Figma or Sketch Mirror app on your phone to view your designs on your device and make sure text sizes/button clicking areas are optimal.

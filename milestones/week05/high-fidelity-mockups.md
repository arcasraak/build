Use your Style Guide and the User Testing feedback to move ahead in creating High Fidelity Mockups.
* Be careful not to scrap everything from one confused user - use your own judgement to act on priority items that were common amongst a majority of your tested users.
* Know that in moving to the UI phase of any project, you are progressing from "how it works" to "how it looks". Determining how something looks is quite subjective, and is an art. Take time to read these guides and principles before diving in, and trust that nothing ever looks amazing the first time around.

* UI Elements:
  * Icons
    * Use open source libraries (like [entypo.com](http://www.entypo.com/)/ and [material.io/icons](https://material.io/icons/))

  * Photos

    * Provide your own

**A note on teamwork**: the more solid your style guide is, the better time you'll have in splitting up pages to divide and conquer. Don't be afraid to over-share your progress (especially half-baked ideas) to stay on the same page with the other designer(s).
  * Use shared symbols wherever possible to minimize work down the line when updating elements.

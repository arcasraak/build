Hurray! You've made it half way through the term. Now we can start progressing from "how it works" to "how it looks". Keep in mind:
* Determining how something looks is quite subjective, and is an art.
* Trust that nothing ever looks amazing the first time around. Do multiple revisions!


#### Determining the *look and feel*:
* [ ] **Pick one grayscale** that has most of the core functionality (likely the home page).
* [ ] Make **3 variations** of this page in Hi-Fidelity (UI design).
* [ ] With your team and your partner, select **one style** that you like, refining as necessary.
* [ ] Use the colors and fonts from this style and create a **style guide** based on that. The finalized style guide is due next week, but get started on it now to move forward in the process.
* [ ] Continue to apply the styles from the style guide to all pages.
* [ ] Use the **User Testing feedback** to iterate and *improve the designs*
  * Be careful not to scrap everything from one confused user - use your own judgment to act on priority items that were common amongst a majority of your tested users.
* [ ] Integrate designs with Zeplin
  * Learn how to use Zeplin with this [handy guide!](https://medium.com/dali-lab/a-guide-to-zeplin-9b1c0dbef0b1)
  * Create your one free [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) account and ask your PM to add you to your group project.
  * As soon as you get your first round of High Fidelity Mockups done, **upload them to your team project** for collaboration with Developers.

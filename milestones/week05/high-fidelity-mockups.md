Progress from "how it works" to "how it looks".

Benefits:
* Understand how one page looks before moving to all
* Clarify visual style

Guidelines:
* Multiple revisions! Trust that nothing ever looks amazing the first time around.
* For Mobile projects, download the Figma app on your phone to make sure text sizes/button clicking areas are optimal.

## Tasks:
*   Use the **User Testing feedback** to iterate and *improve the designs*
  * Be careful not to scrap everything from one confused user.
  * Use your own judgment to act on priority items that were common amongst a majority of your tested users.
*   **Work on one Grayscale** that has most variety of elements/could be visually interesting.
  *   Make **3 mockups** of this page in Hi-Fidelity (UI design).
  *   Select **1 mockup** that your partner and team likes.
*   Start a **style guide** using the styles from that mockup.
*   As soon as you get your first round of High Fidelity Mockups done, **let your developers know** and help them understand how you organized your files (they can find the source code in Figma and export assets).

#### UI Principles:
  * Color
    * 60-30-10 Rule: 60% is your dominant color, 30% is secondary, and 10% is the accent.
    * Be extra careful of color contrast when choosing a [Dark Theme](https://dribbble.com/erikdkennedy/buckets/160688-Dark-themes)
    * Never use pure black
    * A nice [gradient finder](uigradients.com)

  * Typography
    * Start here on [learning font design](https://www.canva.com/learn/font-design/)
    * Read up on everything related to [typography](https://practicaltypography.com/)
    * The [ultimate guide to font sizes](https://learnui.design/blog/ultimate-guide-font-sizes-ui-design.html)
    * Be cautious about mixing Serif (Formal, Old, Wise, Classy) with San Serif (Modern, Simple, Clean)
    * Find your font using Font Kits
      * [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - The largest repository of completely free fonts in the world
      * [Typekit](https://typekit.com/) - Adobe's font service, free with an Adobe Creative Cloud account
      * Determine the character sizes with the [Modular Scale](http://www.modularscale.com/)

  * Grids
    * [Grids](https://spec.fm/specifics/8-pt-grid) are most commonly made in multiples of 8 (because most devices are divisible by 8)
    * Full Width: A full-width design is edge-to-edge of the screen.
    * Floating: A floating design adheres to a fixed-width grid (typically centered).
    * Use this equation to determine the fixed-width grid: **(12 Columns x Column Width) + (11 Gutters x Gutter Width) = Total Layout Width**
    * Make sure your gutters and columns both divisible by 8.
      * NOTE: The standard Nudge+Shift distance is 10px. Not great when youâ€™re working on an 8px grid. Change that to 8px in preferences.
    * Spacing: use the same nudge increment for vertical spacing between elements.

  * Icons
    * Use open source libraries (like [entypo.com](http://www.entypo.com/)/ and [material.io/icons](https://material.io/icons/))
    * [Make your own](https://www.designcrispy.com/use-pen-tool-sketch-master-easy-steps/)

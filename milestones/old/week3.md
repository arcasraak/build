## Project Proposal

This will be a short document outlining your plans for the project.

Here is a template for a project proposal that you should create using the github wiki functionality.

```
# Project Name Proposal
### Team Members

(Insert a Team Photo URL here)

## Problem Statement

What is the problem you are aiming to solve? Who are your target users?

## Impact

Briefly explain how the project meets a real-world need.

## Prior Work

Include any existing solutions and explain how you plan on differentiating your product. You should have ~10 different sources. These can range from commercial/competitive solutions to research papers that inform some part of your product.

## Proposed Solution

Briefly describe your proposed solution.  How does it work and what does it do?

## Team

Who are your team members? Identify what skills each team member brings to the table as well as preferred work style (take charge, work alone, pair programming, etc).

## Strategy

Outline your development strategy with general feature milestones - identify minimum viable product features and optional stretch goals. Explain how you plan to test your product.

## Implementation Challenges

What development challenges have you thought about so far?  Identify any risks and briefly discuss possible workarounds / alternatives.

## Meeting Schedule

You are required to spend at least 10 hours/week. Outline a general weekly meeting schedule with at least 1 time that everybody can make. At least that one meeting must include the entire team in the same room, in person. The rest of the 10 hours may be split into several sessions throughout the week. A nice tool for this is [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/).

```

Your project proposal describes the concept and core components of your project.  It includes things to think about as you are refining the project scope so take a look at this early!


## Github Markdown Files and Repo

We'll use this opportunity to get your first project repo started! You should have had a GitHub repo created for you, if not contact your core mentor and they can set you up.

## GitHub wiki

We'll be using github wikis to keep track of some project documentation. If you haven't used it before [here's how](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/). And some tips on using [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

ðŸš€ [Initialize your wiki now](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/).

And then use the template above to start a page!


![](img/feature_spec.gif){: .fancy .medium}

The feature spec is a document that is a walk-though of your project from the users perspective. It provides a listing of all the features you are envisioning for the product. The feature spec functions as your overall plan for the project. Rather than thinking about it as locking you in, use this as an opportunity to think through your product in detail. Think of it as a living document, donâ€™t be afraid to change it later as your ideas about the project mature. It does not need to be an overly extensive document. Joel Spolsky (of Stackoverflow and more recently Trello) has a nice writeup of the why and how of specs here: [joelonsoftware](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000035.html). He references an [overly long example](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/WhatTimeIsIt.html). Weâ€™ll simplify things a little bit and keep our document shorter and although he says only one person should write the spec, you should definitely do this as your whole team!

## User Stories and Personas

User stories are short scenarios about how your product is used.  User personas are the fictional individuals who comprise your product's users.  Your personas should have names and believable backgrounds.  They should have specific demonstrative use cases for your product.  You will refer to them as you work on the product and you'll find they will be quite useful!  The aim of user stories is to codify specific use cases for your product and allow them to be easily communicated as you build the product.  They help keep the team focused on the functionality of the product for specific people rather than getting sidetracked by features that seem "cool" or "look good".  For every feature in your spec you should have a user persona that would find it useful or compelling. You can use [userforge.com](http://userforge.com) if you want to as it provides a nice interface for creating them.

__Structure your user persona like so:__

* Background and Demographic Information
  * __Name__
  * __Sketch/Picture__
  * __Demographic info__ (short)
  * __Overheard quote__
  * __Short narrative__ or description about the user and why they're using your product/service.
    <br>*(try to capture their attitudes, needs, problems/concerns, and experience)*
* Behavioral and Dimensional Information
  * __Goals and Motivations__
    <br>*(goals should directly relate to product/service)*
  * __Tasks__
    <br>*(break goals down into tasks â€” what does the user need to do to accomplish a particular goal)*
  * __Pain Points__, Concerns, and challenges
    <br>*(what are they worried about? what do they have trouble with?)*
  * __User Flow__
    <br>*(describe a typical scenario of the user interacting with your product â€“ this is a short ordered list of actions)*


Once you have the user personas the feature list for your spec grows easily out of it.  You already know what the users want to do â€” summarize and prioritize.

## Summary

Overall this document does not need to be super extensive, it should cover the features and be a compelling story about your product, but it doesnâ€™t need to be a million pages.

* GitHub repository URL to wiki page you created that includes:
  * Feature Spec as wiki page in your GitHub repo:
    * A list of features, for example:
      * logins
      * profile with name, birthday
      * feed view
      * calculating summary graphs of activity
      (please do not make this exhaustive. No need to talk about which buttons are available on each page â€” just which general action a user would take on that page)
  * At least 3 short AND fun user stories - can be on wiki *or* linked to on wiki but hosted on [userforge.com](http://userforge.com).

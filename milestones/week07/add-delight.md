Merge the userâ€™s interactions with the interface, both stylistically and functionality. Add delight by infusing motion (i.e. **microinteractions**) and thoughtful **copy**.

Benefits:
  * helps guide the user between states, adding focus between elements
  * infuses fun and delight for the user

Guidelines:
* Motion can be **directly built in code** by finding examples for developers and tweaking until it feels right.
* For something specific and **designed from scratch**
  * Use a prototyping tool like [Proto.io](https://proto.io/) or an animation tool like [Adobe After Effects](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/tutorials.html).
  * Identify the *trigger* that initiates the microinteraction, the *rules* to determine what happens, and the *feedback* of what happens.
  * Determine if it *loops, modulates, or ends* after one event.

## Tasks:
  * Introduce intentional moments of motion
    * Transitions - content changes/user moves to another screen
    * Graphical animations - like the a spirit animal dance
    * Microinteractions - tiny details of useful feedback that can help the user love interacting with your product.
  * Clean up copy
      * Personalize the text to unify the "feel" of the product
      * Add microcopy - little unexpected moments of text, like a voiceover
      * Alleviate worry - custom messages to the user go a long way

### Examples:
  * System status (keep your user informed about what is going on)

  * Highlight changes (attract user attention to what is happening)

  * Visualize input (input is quite boring, so jazzing it up makes it special)

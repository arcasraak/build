Add delight by infusing motion (i.e. **microinteractions**) and thoughtful **copy**.


* Motion
Some quick places where you can add motion could be:
  * Transitions (content changes/user moves to another screen)
  * Graphical animations (like the a spirit animal dance)
  * Microinteractions
    * These are tiny details of useful feedback that can help the user love interacting with your product.
    * Present when the user is interacting with an element or waiting for an action to complete.
    * Identify the *trigger* that initiates the microinteraction, the *rules* to determine what happens, and the *feedback* of what happens. Lastly, determine if it *loops, modulates, or ends* after one event.

The motion can be *directly built in code* by finding examples for developers and tweaking until it feels right.
For something specific and designed from scratch, use a *prototyping tool* like [Proto.io](https://proto.io/) or an *animation tool* like [Adobe After Effects](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/tutorials.html).

  * System status (keep your user informed about what is going on)

  * Highlight changes (attract user attention to what is happening)

  * Visualize input (input is quite boring, so jazzing it up makes it special)

* Copy
  * Personalize it for the "feel" of the product
  * Add microcopy (little unexpected moments of text, like a voiceover)
  * Alleviate worry (custom messages to the user go a long way)

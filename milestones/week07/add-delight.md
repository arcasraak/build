Add delight by infusing microinteractions, animations/transitions, and copy.

If you have extra time, and are interested in detailing out these animations in a prototyping tool, start a Proto.io prototype.

* Microinteractions: Tiny details of useful feedback that can help the user love interacting with your product. Identify what the trigger is that initiates the microinteraction, the rules to determine what happens, and then the feedback of what happens. Lastly, decide if it loops, modulates, or ends after one event
  * System status (keep your user informed about what is going on)
  * Highlight changes (attract user attention and not let users overlook what you think is important)
  * Visualize input (data is quite boring, so jazzing it up makes it special)
* Copy: Personalizing copy, adding microcopy
  * Alleviate worry (custom messages to the user go a long way)
  * Make it fun
  * Personalize it

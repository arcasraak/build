Add delight by infusing motion (i.e. **microinteractions**) and thoughtful **copy**.

If you have an interaction-heavy project, start to develop the Interaction Design (IxD). Take care to select the [appropriate prototyping tool](http://www.prototypr.io/prototyping-tools/) for this. For detailed interactions recommended tools are Proto.io, Principle, or Framer. Look ahead to next week where you'll be adding delight, and pace yourself accordingly (i.e. there's time for an animated loading page next week!).

* Motion
Some quick places where you can add motion could be:
  * Transitions (content changes/user moves to another screen)
  * Graphical animations (like the a spirit animal dance)
  * Microinteractions
    * These are tiny details of useful feedback that can help the user love interacting with your product.
    * Present when the user is interacting with an element or waiting for an action to complete.
    * Identify the *trigger* that initiates the microinteraction, the *rules* to determine what happens, and the *feedback* of what happens. Lastly, determine if it *loops, modulates, or ends* after one event.

The motion can be *directly built in code* by finding examples for developers and tweaking until it feels right.

For something specific and designed from scratch (keep the scope small here - think just one little moment or element!), use a *prototyping tool* like [Proto.io](https://proto.io/) or an *animation tool* like [Adobe After Effects](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/tutorials.html).

  * System status (keep your user informed about what is going on)

  * Highlight changes (attract user attention to what is happening)

  * Visualize input (input is quite boring, so jazzing it up makes it special)

* Copy
  * Personalize it for the "feel" of the product
  * Add microcopy (little unexpected moments of text, like a voiceover)
  * Alleviate worry (custom messages to the user go a long way)

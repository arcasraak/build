Add delight by infusing **microinteractions** and thoughtful **copy**.

* Microinteractions:
<br>
Tiny details of useful feedback that can help the user love interacting with your product. Identify what the trigger is that initiates the microinteraction, the rules to determine what happens, and then the feedback of what happens. Lastly, decide if it loops, modulates, or ends after one event.
<br>
The animations can be directly built in code by finding examples for developers and tweaking until it feels right.
For something specific, however, use a prototyping tool like [Proto.io](proto.io) or an animation tool like [Adobe After Effects](https://helpx.adobe.com/after-effects/tutorials.html).

  * System status (keep your user informed about what is going on)

  * Highlight changes (attract user attention to what is happening)

  * Visualize input (input is quite boring, so jazzing it up makes it special)

* Copy:
  * Personalize it for the "feel" of the product
  * Add microcopy (little unexpected moments of text, like a voiceover)
  * Alleviate worry (custom messages to the user go a long way)

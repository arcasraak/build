## DEMOS and User Feedback

MVP demos and testing of the projects for this term. The main focus will be on getting user feedback. Science fair style. Open to public.

### Everyone:
* [ ] Show off your work!
* Important Demo information

### PM:
* Finish any lingering issues
* Wrap up handoff documents
* Send Handoff documents to partner (after approval from staff)
* Celebrate and post-mortem with the team
  * Like a second Retrospective – what did you all learn from this term? What did you accomplish? What would’ve you done differently?

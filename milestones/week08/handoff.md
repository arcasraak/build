If the project continues into the next term, this handoff material will onboard the next team. If the project is not continuing, you will meet with the partner to wrap up any loose ends and deliver the handoff material after the term ends.

### At a Glance:
All details are in the [Finishing Guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OLLSvAzJOz_m4EgEvmyr2Gh9E23G9pAtMGbx7UZ0n50/edit)
* Collect from the team:
  * Updated Style Guide (designers)
  * Updated README (devs)
* Write Handoff doc (be sure to look at the examples from past projects)
* Make sure everything is on the Drive/Github Wiki
  * Put Project Proposal, Feature Spec, Design work, other documents, and important links(Figma) on Github
  * Assets and images of final designs on the Drive
  * Moral here: partner should be able to access everything they need to continue working on the projects
* Write a description and about the process for the website
  * Include pictures (final and from during the process) and a demo video
* DALI attribution on the product
  * Ask devs to add the DALI Logo to the site

*   Make a demo video to show at Technigala and hand off to partner
    * Show off your finished product as a click through of key features. Use Quicktime to capture a clean screen recording of the main interactions in the prototype. Add narration/voice over, text, or music. Aim for 30 seconds to a minute. Work with your partner to determine the features they want to show.

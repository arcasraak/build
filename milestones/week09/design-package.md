Once the designs are finalized, you’re ready to package it up. All designs and mockups are stored in the Drive, so make sure your project’s Google Drive has all relevant design materials.

* **Final full page mockups**: export from your design tool as jpeg or png, do NOT take screenshots
* **Design files:** create a separate document for just the **final** version (process work should be separate). Name the final as "projectname_handoff" and the process file as "projectname_process"
* **Packaged assets:** fonts, images (as png), icons (as svg)
* **Style archive:** the polished, edited, final version of the style guide
* **Demo video:** show off your finished product as a click through of key features (narration, text, or music optional). Keep at 30 seconds to a minute.

This week you’ll be gathering all relevant design information and packaging it in a nice, clean way so it can be sent off to potential future designers and featured/referenced in case studies and portfolios. All final work is stored in the Drive. Create a new folder and title it "Design Package". Include the following:

* **Final full page mockups**:
  * Export from your design tool as jpeg or png, do NOT take screenshots
* **Design files:** (for online projects, make sure Staff is a collaborator, and archive the URL in a text document in the Drive)
  * Create a separate document for just the **final** version (process work should be separate). Name the final "projectname_handoff" and the process file as "projectname_process"
  * Clean up the InDesign board to include all the project inspiration and sketches/process work
* **Packaged assets:** fonts, images (as png), icons (as svg)
* **Style archive:** the final polished version of the style guide
  * Some things to include: typefaces and weights, text attributes, colors, grid spacing, button styling, button states, and logo. Take care to create your style archive in the same design language as your product, so that they could be presented together seamlessly. You’ll submit this as a sketch file.
* **Demo video:** show off your finished product as a click through of key features. Use Quicktime to capture a clean screen recording of the interactions. Add narration/voice over, text, or music. Keep at 30 seconds to a minute. Work with your partner to determine the features they want to show.

Gather all relevant design information and package it so it can be sent off to potential future designers and featured/referenced in case studies and portfolios.

All final work is stored in the **Drive**. Create a new folder and title it *"Design Package"*.

Include the following:

* **PNG mockups**:
  * Export final screens from Figma as jpeg or png (do NOT take screenshots)
* **Figma:**
  * Create a new [Page](https://blog.figma.com/introducing-figma-pages-1363000e6079) for just the final screens and name the page "handoff_month_day".
  * If you have special exportable assets like a logo, clean up the layers a bit so the next person can easily export assets.
* **Style guide (a page in Figma):**
  * Be sure to include typefaces and weights, text attributes, colors, grid spacing, button styling, button states, and logo.
* **Demo video:**
  * Final version and the raw file for future edits.
